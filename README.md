# ml-pipeline
This project attemps to demonstrate how to configure an ml pipeline end to end.

This project shows how an ml flow pipeline should work

## Considerations: 
    1. The model that is being trained here is not the main focus and is just a basic example
    of a prediction model. This project main focus is the pipeline that deploys the model on a 
    production line enviroment.
    2. The project will run on a local machine and should be able to be fully tested on docker
    and a python local environment.
    3. By the end the project should have the next features
        3.1 data cleaning process
        3.2 feature building
        3.3 model training/ retraining process
        3.4 prediction api 
        3.5 testing, codecoverage
        3.6 accuracy model testing
        3.7 artifacts versioning
        3.8 deployment on local machine via docker. 
        3.9 all steps can be automatically run.
        3.10 CI/CD that runs all necessary checks and test (skipping final deploy to cloud for budget reasons).
